## DOTFILES

# Motivation
This is a collection of dotfiles for my personal linux environment. I decided
to bring them online for personal use primarily. Perhaps someday these files
help somebody else, too.

# Project structure
The config files in this project are not dotted. So they are "visible" when
cloning this project. They are located in the respective directory where they
are actually of use. This **should** happen with respect to the filesystem
hierarchy standard ([FHS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filesystem_Hierarchy_Standard)).
But be prepared that locations may differ from the FHS.

# Release model
There are no releases for this project. It's rolling.

# List of current dotfiles
- .vimrc
- .bashrc
- config files for the i3 windowmanager
- .Xdefaults
